# NBA_data_scraper
This module leverages [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to scrape both players and team data
from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).

### Getting Started:

Ensure you have [chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) installed corresponding
to your Chrome browser and placed in a known directory.

For an example, see `Data_Scraper_example.ipynb` on how to use the `NBA_scraper` class.
